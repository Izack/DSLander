Iterate:
set dtemp to 0K
if active:
	if preheating:
		if temp < 323K:
			increase dtemp by 12.3K
	if turbine:
		if temp > 320K:
			if propmass > 100:
				increase rpm to 4000 at 73rpm/sec
				set fuel consumption to rpm*0.000001
				increase dtemp by rpm*0.001K/s
			else:
				disable turbine
		else:
			disable turbine
	else:
		decrease rpm to 0 at 73rpm/sec
		set fuel consumption to rpm*0.000001
		increase dtemp by rpm*0.001K/s
	if cooling:
		if turbine:
			if temp > 723K:
				decrease dtemp by 5K
		else if temp > 323K:
			decrease temp by 5K
else:
	if preheating:
		disable preheating
	if turbine:
		disable turbine
add dtemp to temp
if temp > 820:
	disable turbine
